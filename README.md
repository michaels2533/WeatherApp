Instructions to Install npm on Mac, Windows, and Linux

For Mac:

1. Install Homebrew if you don't have it already by running the following command in the Terminal:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. After Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install Node.js and npm:

brew install node

For Windows:

1. Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version installer.

2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation. The installer includes npm, so you don't need to install it separately.

3. After the installation is complete, you can verify that npm is installed by opening the Command Prompt and running:

npm --version

For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. Update the package index by running the following command in the Terminal:

sudo apt-get update

2. Install Node.js and npm by running:

sudo apt-get install nodejs npm

For Linux (Other Distributions):

The installation process may vary slightly for other Linux distributions like Fedora, CentOS, or Arch Linux. You can refer to the official Node.js documentation for distribution-specific instructions: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

After installing Node.js and npm, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

node --version
npm --version

These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.
